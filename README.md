# Paintkaro — A desktop Paint application in PyQt
Express yourself with Paintkaro, the only painting programme where your art meets your imagination.
Piecasso is a clone of the Paint programme from Windows 95 (ish) with a few additions (and subtractions). The programme features standard tools including pen, brush, fill, spray can, eraser, text and a number of shapes.
